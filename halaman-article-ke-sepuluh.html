            <strong>Welcome to InPanels Development</strong>, a creative and passionate digital development studio committed to crafting innovative web solutions, engaging platforms, and modern user experiences. Founded with vision and ambition, our journey began with a single idea—to build tools, platforms, and experiences that empower creators, connect communities, and shape the digital future.
        </p> <br>
        <p>
            <strong>Our Founding Story</strong> <br>
            InPanels Development was founded by Drevviann, a visionary creator and developer with a deep love for technology, storytelling, and community building. With a strong presence in the creative and tech communities, Drevviann sought to build a platform where innovation could thrive, and where collaboration wasn’t just welcome—it was essential.
        </p> <br>
        <p>
            Alongside him, Kuruto, our brilliant CEO, leads the team with a sharp strategic mind, ensuring that every decision reflects our values, our users' needs, and our long-term mission. Together, Drevviann and Kuruto represent the balance between creativity and structure, spontaneity and strategy.
        </p> <br>
        <p>
            <strong>Our Mission</strong> <br>
            At InPanels Development, our mission is clear:
            To design and develop user-focused platforms that are not only functional but also meaningful, intuitive, and built with heart. We strive to support creators, engage communities, and help brands and individuals grow in the digital world.
        </p> <br>
        <p>
            From sleek website designs and real-time applications to gamified experiences and social features, every line of code we write and every idea we launch is backed by passion, precision, and purpose.
        </p> <br>
        <p>
            <strong>What We Believe In</strong> <br>
            <strong>Community-Driven Development: We believe that the best digital experiences come from understanding people—what they love, what they need, and what they dream of building.</strong>
        </p> <br>
        <p>
            <strong>Transparency and Collaboration:</strong> <br>
            We love to collaborate and often offer free partnerships when it comes to creative, non-commercial projects.
        </p> <br>
        <p>
            <strong>Fair and Clear Value Exchange:</strong> <br>
            While we're open to collaborations at no cost, any collaboration involving public-facing events, monetization, or large-scale exposure may require compensation to support our team and resources. We believe in being fair to both sides—your value matters, and so does ours.
        </p> <br>
        <p>
            <strong>Let’s Collaborate!</strong> <br>
            We’re always on the lookout for passionate creators, innovative startups, community projects, or fellow developers to team up with. Whether you're building a platform, launching a campaign, or starting a movement—we’d love to hear from you.
        </p> <br>
        <p>
            If you’re proposing a free collaboration, we welcome it! But if your idea includes events, branded showcases, large giveaways, or monetized campaigns, we kindly ask that you prepare a small budget. This allows us to dedicate the appropriate team, ensure quality, and respect the time and effort put into every project.
        </p> <br>
        <p>
