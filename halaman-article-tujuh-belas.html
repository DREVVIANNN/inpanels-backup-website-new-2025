                    We are excited to officially roll out Version 4.0.5 of the InPanels.Dev website — a comprehensive update packed with improvements, new content, and fresh collaborations that elevate the entire user experience across our platform.
                <p> <br>
                <p>
                    <strong>What’s New in V4.0.5?</strong> <br>
                    Bug Fixes & Interface Improvements
                    <li class="list-disc"><strong>Verified Badge Hover Bug Fixed:</strong> We heard your feedback! The previously glitchy hover animation on verified badges has now been smoothed out. Whether you're viewing on desktop or mobile, the verified mark now displays perfectly with no visual inconsistencies.</li>
                    <li class="list-disc"><strong>Navbar Simplification:</strong> We've removed some unnecessary list items from the navigation bar to create a cleaner, more focused user interface. Navigation is now faster, and more intuitive — helping you get where you need to be, quicker.</li>

                <p>
                    <strong>And Much More...</strong> <br>
                    V4.0.5 is more than just fixes and features — it’s a step forward in our journey toward making InPanels.Dev not just a website, but a vibrant hub for creators, developers, and fans of visual design. We’ve also laid the groundwork for future event integration, faster loading times, and refined responsiveness across all devices.
